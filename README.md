# TSP_BnB_Algo
The travelling salesman problem (also called TSP) asks the following question: “Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?”. This is what my algorithm tries to achieve using Branch and Bound.

# How To Run TSP Algorithm in terminal

To use the program do the following:

In terminal, type "make"
Then type ./tsp to run Travelling Salesman Problem

Enter the text file name you want to test, which in this case is "input.txt", "input1.txt", "input2.txt","input3.txt", "input4.txt", "test.txt", "test1.txt"

Test Cases
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*
* - Test Case 1 (n = 5) : input.txt                                         *
* - Test Case 2 (n = 10): input1.txt                                        *
* - Test Case 3 (n = 15): input2.txt                                        *
* - Test Case 4 (n = 17): input3.txt                                        *
* - Test Case 5 (n = 20): test.txt (Pruned nodes)                           *
* - Test Case 6 (n = 20): test1.txt                                         *

The program will run, give us a result (minimum cost path) and exit...

Type "make clean" to remove the executable files generated and to start fresh with the program
The program will run and exit...
